# first website
This is the first website I hvae created on MADLAB intro to web development course

this mark down file will also serve as a place to practice myy maekdown text


# A first-level heading 
## A second-level heading 
## A third-level heading 

***this text is bold**
*this text is italic*
~~this is strikethorough text~~

>this text is a quote

to make text appear as code we use `backticks` and it willl change the appearance of the contained words
```triple backticks creates a block of code```
