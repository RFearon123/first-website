            The Krampus is a horned anthropomorphic figure who, in the Austrian folkloric tradition, is said to accompany Saint Nicholas 
            on visits to children during the night of 5 December (Krampusnacht; "Krampus Night"), immediately before the Feast of St. Nicholas on 6 December. 
            In this tradition, Saint Nicholas rewards well-behaved children with small gifts, 
            while Krampus punishes badly behaved ones with birch rods. He was originally assosciated with pagans but then the devil.

            Krampusnacht is celebrated on December 5 every year across Germany, 
            other European countries, and Australia. It occurs the night before the celebration of 
            the Feast of St. Nicholas, a night when people dress up as the devil Krampus 
            and chase naughty children through the streets.
